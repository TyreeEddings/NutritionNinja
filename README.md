# NutritionNinja
## What is NutritionNinja?
- NutritionNinja is an all-in-one nutrition and wellness application

## How does it make an impact? What problem does it aim to solve?
- Malnutrition is a huge problem in our world. When we think of "Malnutrition", we think of the pictures of malnourished african children we so often see on the web. That's only a PART of the problem. Malnutrition isn't just eating "too little" or "too much", it's about overall *poor* nutrition. Good nutrition is often overlooked by the younger generations, as they have too much to worry about already within this constantly changing world. Nutrition Ninja aims to fix that, by providing an easy-access way for people to log their meals, and get nutritional information back from the application. This not only takes out the hard part from the equation, but as users continue to use the application, their data will be compiled into an expansive database that uses their own eating/nutrition habits/trends to return better data, allowing the system to better recommend nutritional advice and help users on a path to a balanced, nutritional diet. Alongside these great features, NutritionNinja will eventually be able to provide meaningful information that can help users learn about what nutrition is and how to maintain balanced diets and better eating habits, through helpful tips, infographics, and possibly even videos!

## Where can you find the application?
[You can find the Nutrition Ninja Web application here!](https://tyreeeddings.github.io/nutritionninja/)

## How do you use the application?
Nutrition Ninja aims to help eliminate the scourge of malnutrition in our society. In this experimental testing branch, you can interact with a few **limited** features: A responsive chatbot, nicknamed "NinjaBot", which uses GPT 3.5 to provide immersive responsive to users*; An interactive recipe book, allowing users to find recipies with certain ingredients**; A functional goals page, in which users can input their daily caloric intake and macro ratios, and get interactive datacharts in response***

*Due to OpenAI policy, NinjaBot is nonfunctional within this test branch.
**As of now, the recipe dataset is limited to a few hundred different ingredients/recipes.
***Within this tet branch, datacharts will not save between sessions, and updating them simply changes the data used in the response. We aim to improve this within a future update!

*The team here at HQ apologizes for any inconvenience these stipulations may cause on your journey towards nutritional wellness!*
