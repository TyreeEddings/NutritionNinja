## How does it make an impact? What problem does it aim to solve?
- Malnutrition is a huge problem in our world. When we think of "Malnutrition", we think of the pictures of malnourished african children we so often see on the web. That's only a PART of the problem. Malnutrition isn't just eating "too little" or "too much", it's about overall *poor* nutrition. Good nutrition is often overlooked by the younger generations
